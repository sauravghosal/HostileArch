# Purpose
Hostile architecture is construction which goes out of its way to make it difficult for homeless people and other vulnerable populations to survive in the city. Much of this architecture goes unnoticed: spikes on the ground, dividers on benches, and walls to keep people out. But once you notice it, you see it all around you. The construction unfairly targets those who are vulnerable in the city, stripping them of places to sit or sleep. We believe that hostile architecture, which is becoming pervasive in large cities, **needs to be called out and stopped.**
This cross-platform app allows users to take a picture of hostile architecture that they come across, retreive their current location, and send **a call-to-action** email to their local government representative. **Let's fix this space**!
# Starting the App
To run the back end for our program, go into the root directory and type into your command line the following:

    python app.py
Make sure you have all the required python modules installed. You can use pip to install there if you haven't already.

For the front end, go onto your command line and into the hostile-arch-app nested folders and type

    expo start
  
You'll need to have installed the **Expo app** on your phone in order to run the mobile-friendly (IOS) version of our program. You can scan the barcode for the expo developer tools website that displays to link you to the mobile version of the application.
