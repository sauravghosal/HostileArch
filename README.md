# Fix this Space!
# Purpose
Hostile architecture is construction which goes out of its way to make it difficult for homeless people and other vulnerable populations to survive in the city. Much of this architecture goes unnoticed: spikes on the ground, dividers on benches, and walls to keep people out. But once you notice it, you see it all around you. The construction unfairly targets those who are vulnerable in the city, stripping them of places to sit or sleep. We believe that hostile architecture, which is becoming pervasive in large cities, **needs to be called out and stopped.**
This cross-platform app allows users to take a picture of hostile architecture that they come across, retreive their current location, and send **a call-to-action** email to their local government representative. **Let's fix this space**!
